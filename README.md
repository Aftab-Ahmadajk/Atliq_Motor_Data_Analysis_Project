## **``Introduction``**:
**AtliQ Motors** is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV). Their market share in North America's electric and hybrid car segment increased to 25% over the previous five years. They intended to introduce their best-selling models in India, where their market share is less than 2%, as part of their expansion plans. Before moving further, Bruce Haryali, the CEO of AtliQ Motors India, wants to do a thorough market analysis of the country's current EV/Hybrid industry. As part of AtliQ Motors' strategic expansion plans, I conducted a comprehensive market analysis of the Indian electric vehicle (EV) industry. To facilitate data analysis and visualization throughout this process, I utilized Microsoft Power BI as my primary tool.

## **``Objectives``**:
AtliQ Motors aims to expand its market share in Indiaâ€™s rapidly growing EV sector. To do so, a comprehensive analysis of the current market landscape, key growth trends, and sales data by region and category is needed to uncover actionable insights and strategic recommendations.

### **Stakeholders**:
The stakeholders for this comprehensive market research report are as follows:

- **Bruce Haryali** Chief of AtliQ Motors India, who requires a thorough market study of the existing EV and hybrid vehicle market in India to inform future strategic initiatives.
- **Data Analytics Team at AtliQ Motors** responsible for gathering, analyzing, and interpreting market data to provide actionable insights and support the objectives of this study.

## **``Data Source``**:
The dataset has been sourced from the Codebasics website in partnership with their collaborator, who provides open access to the public for data analysis and insight generation, making it a valuable educational resource. You can access the data [here](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge). I have obtained additional data to support and broaden the scope of this analysis.

## **``Data Description``**:
The dataset for this project comprises three CSV files: (1) Date Dimension Table, (2) Electric Vehicle Sales by Manufacturer, and (3) Electric Vehicle Sales by State. Covering a period from March 1, 2021, to March 31, 2024, the data spans three consecutive years and is structured to align with the Indian fiscal year, which runs from April 1 to March 31. The data is organized to facilitate analysis for extracting meaningful insights.
## **``Data Exploration``**:
I collected three data files in comma-separated tab format. In the 'Electric Vehicle Sales by State' file, I identified inconsistencies, as one column was contracted and requires splitting into multiple columns. Additionally, the Date Dimension table is organized by calendar year.  I need to transform it to align with the Indian fiscal year for more accurate and meaningful insights.
## **``Data Cleaning``**:
I performed data transformation operations, including tasks such as splitting data into distinct columns, such as date, vehicle category, state name, electric vehicles sold, and total vehicles sold. Additionally, to ensure data integrity and accuracy, I thoroughly examined the dataset, confirming that there are no duplicate values. 
## **``Data Modeling``**
Data modeling in Power BI is a highly effective initial approach for deriving data-driven insights, providing a clear framework for aligning data to generate actionable results. The star schema and snowflake schema techniques in Power BI enhance data handling capabilities and improve overall efficiency. As previously mentioned, I was provided with three tables. After developing a comprehensive understanding of the data, I established a one-to-many relationship between the dim_date table and the sales-by-state table by linking the date columns. I also created a connection between the dim_date table and the sales-by-maker table. Subsequently, I incorporated an additional table containing data on public charging stations for electric vehicles, which further supported our data analysis process.
